>now master is the most up to date

Julia
>thx haotian

Haotian
>Tmr Iâ€™ll probably not wake up before afternoon

Julia
>Haha ok
    I will not be free until 6ish

Haotian
>The things to do are just writing doc for each class, each method.
ReadMe. Rewrite the two sections of DESIGN to reflect our structures
And test the simulations with larger grids
Basically these three things. If our ddl is after Monday, then no worry at alll

Julia
>Ok cool. I can update the design doc about the changes to UIManager and CA and any other parts. Will also write some more simulations

Haotian
>Also, in readme and the different classes. I put author based on my feeling
If there is any wrong stuff, just make changes and tell the group

Haotian
>So um is our deadline Monday then
I mean Tuesday 308?

Julia
>Yes
I believe so
Almost back on campus so I will get started with my part soon
do either of you understand what the team sprint report is?
i will not be in class on tuesday because of grace hopper, but it seems like we might be completing it during class?

Haotian
>Oh wow came back to life
ISO much work ðŸ˜ž
Iâ€™ll check it out later

Julia
>yeah no worries
there's nothing on the course website describing what it is
Then Iâ€™ll guess it will be done in class
i think i found a bug in wator rule - only sharks are reproducing and fish arent - i will make a quick fix

Haotian
>is the fish working now?

Yunhao
>i belive in the power of haotian we can do It
@Julia Saveliff update us about how it goes if still not working i will try debug it tmr morningðŸ˜‚

Julia
>Oops so sorry!!! It is fixed! All changes are pushed to master
I added more test files if you want to check them out

Yunhao
>Everything looks good, I have added some comments.

Julia
>the complete implementation is released
i will likely not be able to do very much between tuesday and friday - but if we want to plan tasks for each of us to work on, i can try my best to get it done this week - otherwise i will work on whatever is left to do when i get back
and here is the sprint reflection - it's individual but we might need to discuss certain parts together - like planning who will do which components

>no - the reflection is due by end of class tmrw
the complete implementation is due in one week mon 308am
